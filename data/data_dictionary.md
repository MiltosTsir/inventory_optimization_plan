# Data Dictionary â€“ Inventory Dataset

This dataset (`inventory_dataset_100_products.xlsx`) contains **simulated data** for 100 products.  
It is designed to demonstrate inventory optimization formulas (EOQ, Safety Stock, Reorder Point).

## Notes
- All values are **simulated** for demonstration purposes only.  
- Units of measurement are consistent across products.  
- These fields are enough to calculate:  
  - **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**  
  - **Safety Stock**  
  - **Reorder Point (ROP)**
